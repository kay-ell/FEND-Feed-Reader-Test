## How to load test

To load, simply open index.html using your favorite web browser (recommend Google Chrome). 
- Scroll down to the bottom of the page to check the status of the tests.
- You can click 'run all' to run all the tests. Or click on each individual test to run them individually
- If all tests passed, the line that specifies the number of specs and number of failures will be 'green' with '0' failures
- If a test fails, the line would be highlighted 'red', and tells you how many failures it has. Below that, you will see exactly what went wrong in your code.
